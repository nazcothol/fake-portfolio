    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>This site may not be as slick as <a href="https://pageandsound.com/"><text x="10" y="25">Page and Sound</text></a>, but there is a reason for that. The goal for this site is to serve as a playground to show off and try all the techie things I'm learning. Everything here is made from scratch. No WordPress, just straight HTML, CSS, Javascript, and other bare-bones technologies that I'm learning. Projects shared here may be rough, but that's how learnings work.
